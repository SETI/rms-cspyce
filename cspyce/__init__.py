CSPYCE OVERVIEW

cspyce is a Python module that provides an interface to the CSPICE library. It
implements the most widely-used functions of CSPICE in a Python-like way. It
also supports numerous enhancements, including support for Python exceptions,
array inputs, and aliases.

This version of the library has been built for the CSPICE toolkit v. 67.

cspyce contains Python interfaces to all CSPICE functions likely to be useful
to a Python programmer. Excluded are deprecated functions and various low-level
functions supporting character strings, cells, sets, file I/O, and also all
low-level "geometry finder" functions that can only be implemented in C. It
also includes vectorized versions (with suffix "_vector") for nearly every
function that receives floating-point input and does not perform I/O.

ADDED FEATURES

DOCSTRINGS
- All cspyce functions have informative docstrings, so typing
      help(function)
  provides useful information. However, the call signature appearing in the
  first line of the help text is still defined by cspyce0 and may not make
  sense to the reader. This issue is fixed by module cspyce2.

DEFAULTS
- Many cspyce functions take sensible default values if input arguments are
  omitted.
  - In gcpool, gdpool, gipool, and gnpool, start values default to 1.
  - The functions that take "SET" or "GET" as their first argument (erract,
    errdev, errprt, and timdef) have simplified calling options, which are
    summarized in their docstrings.

RUNTIME ERROR HANDLING

In the CSPICE error handling mechanism, the programmer must check the value
of function failed() regularly to determine if an error has occurred. However,
Python's exception handling mechanism obviates the need for this approach. In
cspyce1, all CSPICE errors raise Python exceptions.

In CSPICE, the programmer can control how C errors are handled using the
function erract(). Options include "IGNORE", "REPORT", "ABORT", "DEFAULT",
and "RETURN", In cspyce1, the "IGNORE" and "REPORT" options are disabled,
because they can leave behind corrupted memory. In interactive Python, the
"ABORT" and "DEFAULT" options are also disabled, because aborting an
interactive session would be pointless. The "ABORT" and "DEFAULT" options are
still available, though not recommended, when running programs
non-interactively.

The cspyce1 module supports two additional error actions, which are variants
on "RETURN". These are "EXCEPTION" and "RUNTIME". The only difference between
them is that "RUNTIME" consistently raises RuntimeError exceptions, whereas
"EXCEPTION" tailors the type of the exception to the situation.

HANDLING OF ERROR FLAGS

Many CSPICE functions bypass the library's own error handling mechanism;
instead they return a status flag, sometimes called "found" or "ok", or else
an empty response might indicate failure. The cspyce module provides
alternative options for these functions.

Within cspyce1, functions that return error flags have an alternative
implementation with a suffix of "_error", which uses cspyce1's Python
exception handling instead. For example, bodn2c(name) is the function that
returns two values given the name of a body, its body ID and a True/False flag
indicating whether the name was recognized. bodn2c_error() instead just
returns a single value, the body ID. However, it raises a Python exception
(KeyError or RuntimeError, depending on the erract setting) if the name is not
recognized.

The cspyce1 module provides several ways to control which version of the
function to use:

- The function use_flags() takes a function name or list of names and
  designates the original version of each function as the default. If the
  input argument is missing, _flag versions are selected universally.  With
  this option, for example, a call to cspyce.bodn2c() will actually call
  cspyce1.bodn2c_flag().

- The function use_errors() takes a function name or list of names and
  designates the _error version of each function as the default. If the input
  argument is missing, _error versions are selected universally. With this
  option, for example, a call to cspyce1.bodn2c() will actually call
  cspyce1.bodn2c_error() instead.

You can also choose between the "flag" and "error" versions of a function
using cspyce function attributes, as discussed below.

FUNCTION ATTRIBUTES

Like any other Python class, functions can have attributes. These are used to
simplify the choices of function options in cspyce1. Every cspyce1 function
has these attributes:

  error   = the version of this function that raises exceptions intead of
            returning flags.
  flag    = the version that returns flags instead of raising exceptions.
  vector  = the vectorized version of this function.
  scalar  = the un-vectorized version of this function.

If a particular option is not relevant to a function, the attribute still
exists, and instead simply returns the function itself. This makes it trivial
to choose a particular combination of features for a particular function call.
For example:
  ckgpav.vector()         same as ckgpav_vector()
  ckgpav.vector.flag()    same as ckgpav_vector()
  ckgpav.vector.error()   same as ckgpav_vector_error()
  ckgpav.error.scalar()   same as ckgpav_error()
  ckgpav.flag()           same as ckgpav()
  bodn2c.vector()         same as bodn2c()
  bodn2c.flag()           same as bodn2c()
